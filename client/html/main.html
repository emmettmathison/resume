                <p>Emmett Mathison is a 22 year old composer and programmer from Los Angeles. His work explores
                    pop-forms and life-forms.

                    He has toured and recorded throughout the U.S. <br><br>Emmett's compositions draw from an array of
                    influences
                    including contemporary pop music, the Torah, the Nag Hammadi, the Corpus Hemeticum,
                    cosmist/transhumanist literature and SETI. Much of his music is playable by anyone, regardless of
                    musical training. He is interested in the potential of collective sound-making to democratize the
                    experience of sonic group-mind. <br><br>

                    Emmett has worked in consulting and curatorial capacities for arts institutions including National
                    Sawdust (NY) and Red Bull Arts NY. He is currently working as a chess teacher at schools and
                    programs throughout the U.S. He also enjoys space stuff, and is working with MIT SEDS to research
                    the pedogenic effects of organic acids on lunar regolith. For fun, he grows cordyceps, lion’s mane,
                    and reishi.

                    <br><br>Emmett attended the University of Michigan from 2016-2018 as a double major in religion and
                    jazz
                    piano. He is currently earning a BM in Contemporary Improvisation from the New England Conservatory
                    of Music, where he has studied with Bruce Brubaker, Ran Blake, and Jonathan Feldman.
